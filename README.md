# Final-Project

Efficient algorithm for scheduling jobs with precedent constraints and communication delay has beena classical open problem in scheduling area for a long time. In recent work new type of algorithmshave been developed for this problem and achieve first non-trivial result for this problem in a longtime. Inspired by their breakthrough work, we hope to extend the work to more general cases. Wewill study theoretical/empirical promising algorithms for scheduling jobs with precedent constraintsand non-uniform communication delays (For example, delay depends on jobs).
